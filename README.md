# PROGRESSIVE TIMER by Mizin

A robust tool designed for Visual Jockeys and Resolume Arena users to create custom Progressive Timer plugins (FFGL). 

This application allows you to simulate the timer logic visually in the browser and then generates the necessary C++ source code to compile a native `.dll` plugin for Resolume.

## Features

*   **Progressive Timing**: Counts up from 00:00.
*   **Time Limit Control**: Set a specific limit (e.g., 5 minutes) where the behavior changes.
*   **Visual Thresholds**: Changes text color automatically as time runs out:
    *   30 Seconds (Green)
    *   15 Seconds (Blue)
    *   10 Seconds (Yellow)
    *   5 Seconds (Red)
*   **Final Message**: Displays a custom message (e.g., "TIME UP") when the limit is reached.
*   **Blink Alert**: Optional blinking effect for the final message.
*   **Font Selection**: Use standard web fonts or scan your local system fonts to use specific typography.
*   **Code Generation**: Exports ready-to-use C++ code for the FFGL SDK.

## How to Use

### 1. Design Phase (Web App)
1.  Use the **Sidebar** to configure your timer.
2.  **Appearance**: Select your font and size. Click the Search icon to load fonts installed on your computer.
3.  **Time & Limit**: Set the duration limit in seconds.
4.  **Colors**: Customize the colors for each time threshold.
5.  **End Event**: Define the message displayed when time is up and toggle blinking.
6.  Use the **Start/Pause/Reset** buttons to preview the behavior in real-time.

### 2. Build Phase (FFGL C++)
1.  Once satisfied with the design, click the **Generate C++ / DLL Code** button.
2.  Wait for the AI to generate the source code.
3.  Click **Copy Code**.

### 3. Compilation (Visual Studio)
1.  Download the [FFGL SDK](https://github.com/resolume/ffgl).
2.  Open Visual Studio and create a new C++ Project based on the FFGL examples.
3.  Replace the main plugin source file content with the code generated by this tool.
4.  Compile the project in **Release Mode (x64)**.
5.  Locate the generated `.dll` file.

### 4. Installation
1.  Copy the `.dll` file.
2.  Paste it into the Resolume Arena effects folder (usually `Documents/Resolume Arena/Extra Effects`).
3.  Restart Resolume Arena.
4.  Search for **PROGRESSIVE TIMER by Mizin** in the Effects panel.
